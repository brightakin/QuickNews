        My name is Akinkuotu Bright, I am a software engineer who has focused on
        developing efficient and impactful react native applications for more
        than three years. I have worked across industries and sectors leaving my
        mark everytime i write a line of code. I have also impacted junior
        developers when I was given leadership roles ensuring the progress and
        success of the company even when I am not there anymore. Due to my
        unending love for new challenges and making an impact across countries,
        I decided that a role at Quickcheck would be a good step in my career
        and will also serve as a testament to my mantra of making an impact.
        Additionally Iâ€™m a highly motivated, diligent, hardworking and honest
        young man enthusiastic about contributing towards achieving outlined
        objectives and team success, through thoughtful approaches driven by
        utmost passion for excellence. I would welcome the opportunity to be a
        part of your outstanding workforce. Thank you for your time and
        consideration, I look forward to hearing from you.
