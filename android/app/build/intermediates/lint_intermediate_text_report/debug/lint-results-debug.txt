/Users/toluwase/Documents/QuickNews/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:14: Warning: Redundant label can be removed [RedundantLabel]
        android:label="@string/app_name"
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "RedundantLabel":
   When an activity does not have a label attribute, it will use the one from
   the application tag. Since the application has already specified the same
   label, the label on this activity can be omitted.

/Users/toluwase/Documents/QuickNews/android/app/build.gradle:125: Warning: A newer version of androidx.browser:browser than 1.2.0 is available: 1.5.0 [GradleDependency]
    implementation "androidx.browser:browser:1.2.0"
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

/Users/toluwase/Documents/QuickNews/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:10: Warning: The attribute android:allowBackup is deprecated from Android 12 and higher and may be removed in future versions. Consider adding the attribute android:dataExtractionRules specifying an @xml resource which configures cloud backups and device transfers on Android 12 and higher. [DataExtractionRules]
      android:allowBackup="false"
                           ~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "DataExtractionRules":
   Before Android 12, the attributes android:allowBackup and
   android:fullBackupContent were used to configure all forms of backup,
   including cloud backups, device-to-device transfers and adb backup.

   In Android 12 and higher, these attributes have been deprecated and will
   only apply to cloud backups. You should instead use the attribute
   android:dataExtractionRules, specifying an @xml resource that configures
   which files to back up, for cloud backups and for device-to-device
   transfers, separately. If your minSdkVersion supports older versions,
   you'll still want to specify an android:fullBackupContent resource if the
   default behavior is not right for your app.

/Users/toluwase/Documents/QuickNews/android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-hdpi/ic_launcher_foreground.png: Warning: The resource R.mipmap.ic_launcher_foreground appears to be unused [UnusedResources]

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.


   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests =true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests =true.

/Users/toluwase/Documents/QuickNews/android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-mdpi/ic_launcher_round.png: Warning: Launcher icons should not fill every pixel of their square region; see the design guide for details [IconLauncherShape]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconLauncherShape":
   According to the Android Design Guide
   (https://d.android.com/r/studio-ui/designer/material/iconography) your
   launcher icons should "use a distinct silhouette", a "three-dimensional,
   front view, with a slight perspective as if viewed from above, so that
   users perceive some depth."

   The unique silhouette implies that your launcher icon should not be a
   filled square.
